# Cervical-Web

Cervical Cancer Project Website Node

## Description

A website made with the sole purpose of Data labeling. We had tons of data to label and the ones to label the data were a team of doctors from BSMMU hospital with
little to no technical knowledge in CS field. So, I made this simple web application to allow them to easily login and start annotating the data, which we would later
use to train our model.
